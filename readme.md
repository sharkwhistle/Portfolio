This is my Build a Portfolio project for the Udacity Fullstack Nanodegree. It
demonstrates a responsive grid-based framework, which I created purely in CSS.
It is optimized for viewing across small, medium, and large devices. The page
includes an svg logo which I created, along with 4 images, which are some
examples of my own photographic work. The website is based off of the provided
Udacity mockup. The images are subject to change as I progress through the
Nanodegree, and will be replaced by links to projects that I will be working on
throughout the remainder of the course.
